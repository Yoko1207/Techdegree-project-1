        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>A few years ago, I took over my co-worker's tasks which included updating 
          the homepage of our company. Although I was always interested in making a website, 
          I had never written any codes before. At first, she explained to me how to change 
          the color of a button, and let me do it on my own.
          I typed "red" in CSS and reload the page...BAM! The color of the button was changed 
          to red, of course.</p>
        <p>But that was my initial magic moment when I was hooked on coding.
          Instead of using a brush or colored marker, you can change color or anything else 
          just by typing! It was a completely new concept to me. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to be able to build websites that are user-friendly, visually appealing, 
          and optimized for search engine ranking with proper codes. In order to achieve the goal,
          I need to master those skills:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another goal is to work for a web design company and eventually be a freelancer 
          traveling around the world.</p>
